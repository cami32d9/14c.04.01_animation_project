# To-do list

- Should we use another font for the infobox-details? It's hard to read body text with that font.
- The second o in "Korou" comes in at a weird time
- Fix proper timing of the names and the lines between then, so animation doesn't overlap or takes too long
- Fix music-button so it toggles, instead of starting the music again and again
